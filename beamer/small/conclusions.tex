\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Contractions of the sphere $\rightarrow$ effective dynamics are irreversible.
        \item Effective dynamics are not necessarily unitary nor quantum channels.
        \item Limiting case $p_{1}=1$ of studied dynamics lead to quantum channels (linear assignment map).
        \item Explicit dependence in noise terms seems to induce non-linearity.
        \item Differences with classical non-linearity: changes in entropy / universal dynamics.
    \end{itemize}
