\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Contractions of the sphere $\rightarrow$ irreversible evolutions.
        \item Hence, effective dynamics are irreversible.
        \item Effective dynamics are not unitary nor quantum channels.
        \item Limiting cases ($p=0$ or $p=1$) of studied dynamics lead to quantum channels.
        \item Noise terms induce non-linearity.
    \end{itemize}
